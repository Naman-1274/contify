    if data['category'] == "Email Subject Lines":
        return f"""You are an expert fashion brand copywriter creating email subject lines that sound completely human and aspirational. Write like the most successful luxury fashion marketers.

Create 8-10 email subject lines in this EXACT format, each separated by a line break:

Study these reference examples for tone and style:
- "Made for Moments That Can't Repeat"
- "Effortless Glamour for Every Occasion ‚Äî The Wedding Edit by Dolly J"
- "Introducing Kami, the dresses you'll fall in love with üå∏"
- "Freesia Dreams for Festive Evenings üíñ"
- "Celebrate Bonds: Up to 10% Off Our Rakhi Collection"

Your lines should:
‚Ä¢ Mix poetic headlines with product introductions
‚Ä¢ Include the brand/collection name naturally: "{data['product']}"
‚Ä¢ Use emotional storytelling like "Celebrate Bonds" or "Made for Moments"
‚Ä¢ IMPORTANT: If discount is {data['discount']}% and greater than 0, include it naturally in 2-3 subject lines
‚Ä¢ Reference occasion: {data['festival']}
‚Ä¢ Add urgency when relevant: {data['timing']}
‚Ä¢ Use 1-2 emojis ONLY when they enhance the premium feel
‚Ä¢ Sound like something a human brand expert would write, not AI
‚Ä¢ Keep each line under {data['char_limit']} characters

Avoid these words completely: {', '.join(BANNED_WORDS)}

Create lines that:
1. Start with aspirational emotion or moment
2. Introduce collection/product name
3. Highlight craft or benefit
4. Connect to occasion or urgency
5. Mix short punchy lines with longer storytelling ones

Each line should feel premium, human, and designed to make someone want to open the email.

Write ONLY the subject lines, one per line, and make sure they build emotional flow across multiple ideas. Vary the structure, but keep the human storytelling natural and non-repetitive.
